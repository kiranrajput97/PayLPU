# PayLPU

The project was to design and develop a multi-functional Android app that will help the users to perform transactions to nearby shops, Hospitals, Malls, Universities. The app run on the closed network which also allowed the app to function without the internet on Intra-network. The capabilities of the application Including InternetLess Transactions and the user can send the money from 1 UPI to another without even changing the account or UPI. The app supported a custom created API which allows the application to make a payment through any available UPI present in the system.
for Example, Users can use the app to send money to another user from the GPAY UPI to Paytm UPI without any problem. 

This application was part of my capstone project.
